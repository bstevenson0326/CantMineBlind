## ⛏️ Can't Mine Blind

This mod improves the mining experience by automatically displaying the roof overlay while mining and optionally marking thin (green) roofs for deconstruction.

### 🔹 Features

- Automatically enables the roof overlay when selecting the mining tool
- Restores your previous roof overlay setting when deselecting
- Optional setting to auto-mark thin (light green) roofs for removal
- Prevents tedious manual toggling and misclicks
- Helps avoid accidental cave-ins by visualizing roof risk
- In-game mod settings for toggling each feature
- Harmony patching for safe integration

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Thin roof removal does **not** guarantee safety — unknown roofs can still fall on colonists!
